In this project, we propose that social sensing could address bottlenecks in worker's awareness, interpretation of the informatics, and subsequent behavioral change. Through a four-week technology probe study involving flexible long-hour professional drivers (Taxi and Uber drivers) and their significant others, we found that while technological sensing was able to increase drivers' awareness of their well-being status and intention to modify behaviors. The ``social sensing'' design was able to further shape such awareness or intention into action, highlighting the potential of using the sociotechnical approach in promoting work-life balance among long-hour workers.",publications:[{body:"Go Gig or Go Home: Enabling Social Sensing to Share Personal Data with Intimate Partner for the Health and Wellbeing of Long-Hour Workers.
